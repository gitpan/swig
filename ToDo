Dave's "To do" list (feel free to jump in and do any one of these
things if you're so inclined).

- Write on a FAQ (or find a volunteer willing to maintain one).

- Work on the SWIG library.   (Ongoing)

- Improve support for using SWIG with multiple files.  There
  are still some problems with C++ and multiple files.

- Write a typemap library for handling arrays, lists, and other
  useful objects.

- Continued improvements to C++

     -  Function overloading
     -  Templates (partially supported now)
     -  Operator overloading

- Support of Objective-C protocols.

- The great Parser rewrite (in progress).

- Work on a way to turn the SWIG library into a collection
  of pre-built modules for various scripting languages.

- Preprocessor tools.   Might be possible to create some
  tools for creating interface files from highly cluttered
  header files.

- Modify SWIG to look in the Windows Registry for default
  settings.

- Continued development of the experimental MATLAB module.

- Bring the Guile module up to speed with the latest version
  of FSF Guile.  It basically needs an entire rewrite.

Big projects (for people with lots and lots of spare time...) :

- SWIG Fortran.    A Fortran front-end to SWIG language modules.

- SWIG Java.  Enough said.

- A Visual Basic module (or perhaps just a COM binding).

- The great Parser rewrite (in progress).
    
- Develop a method for specifying and enforcing functional 
  dependencies (send e-mail for more details).
