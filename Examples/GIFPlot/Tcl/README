Tcl examples

You may have to edit the Makefile to get this to compile (assumes dynamic
loading).

plotter.tcl        -  An simple 2D function plotting utility.
mandel.tcl         -  Plots the Mandelbrot set and lets you 
                      navigate around.
simple.tcl         -  A very simple plot.

To run the examples, simply run wish on the script file. For example,
'wish plotter.tcl'.
