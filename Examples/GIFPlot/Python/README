This directory contains a variety of Python examples.  Some files are
import modules loaded by other examples in this directory.  See the list
below for a description.

simple.py       A simple Python script that draws an image and save it
                to a file.

image.py        These three files define a collection of base classes
image2d.py      for making 2D and 3D plots.   These extend the C library
image3d.py      with functions for drawing tickmarks, axis, annotation,
                and other capabilities.    They also show how one can
                inherit from C structures in Python.

plotfunc.py     Plots a simple function using the image base classes. Run
                Python on this file to run.

plotmesh.py     Reads a finite-element mesh and makes a series of plots.

weblog.py       Reads a web-server log and makes a collection of 2D and 3D
                plots.

scene.py        Creates a simple 3D image.

plotfunc3d.py   Makes a collection of 3D function plots.


Note : Some of these scripts read data located in the Data directory.  You
may need to modify some of these scripts on non-Unix platforms.

To view images, use any GIF compatible viewer such as 'xv'.  It is also
possible to interactively play with many of the scripts.  If you run xv
with the -poll option, it will automatically update an image each time the
file changes--allowing you to mess around and watch your changes.
