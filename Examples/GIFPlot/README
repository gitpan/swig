GIFPlot is a graphics library for building simple image generation
tools.  The library consists primarily of a 2D and 3D plotting
primitives that may eventually be used to build a more sophisticated
package.  Output is in the form of uncompressed GIF files.

"GIFPlot" is only a working name right now.  I need to come
up with something cooler (suggestions welcome).

*** Note *** 

Due to the Unisys enforcement of the LZW compression patent, this
version only produces uncompressed GIF images.

Introduction
============

GIFPlot is a relatively simple graphics library for making 2D and
3D images.

This example shows how SWIG can be used to produce scripting interfaces
to a real software package.   The Tcl, Python, and Perl directories
contain makefiles and examples for those languages.   The scripting
interface is completely generated from a common SWIG interface file 
found in the "Interface" directory.   

Getting all of the pieces of this example to work will likely require
some Makefile hacking.  If you haven't used SWIG before, you may want
to play around with some simple examples first.

Installation
=============

1.   How to install (UNIX)

GIFPlot creates a C library.   To build the package type :

	./configure
	make

This will create a library in this directory for use.

2.  Documentation

Documentation is available as an HTML file in the Doc directory.

3.  Examples

Several C examples are available in the Examples directory.

4.  SWIG Examples

This example is provided with the SWIG distribution to demonstrate
a more sophisticated application with a variety of features.  The
subdirectories "Tcl", "Python", and "Perl" build different interfaces
to this package.  Makefiles are also provided for Unix, Win95/NT, and
Macintosh.

Windows Users
==============

1.  Go to the 'Lib' and type 'nmake /f Makefile.msc' to build the
    GIFPlot library.

2.  Go to the 'Tcl', 'Python', or 'Perl' libraries to build SWIG
    examples.   The file 'Makefile.msc' in each directory is
    used to build extensions.
