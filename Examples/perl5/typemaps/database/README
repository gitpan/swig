This example shows how one might pass C structures to and
from Perl as arrays instead of pointers using typemaps.

In this case, we'll parse the /etc/passwd file and convert it
to and from a C representation.

Disclaimer : This is somewhat hideous.  While I think it's correct,
it's entirely possible I have misinterpreted something in perlguts(1).
