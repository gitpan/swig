Objective-C Example

This is a very simple example involving some Objective-C code.

Disclaimer : This is highly experimental and has only been tested
with gcc 2.7.2 under Linux 2.0.28.   

To build an Objective-C module, run swig with the -objc option.
Also, you need to make sure your interface file includes the
file 'objc.i'.  This file contains some definitions and support
code to make Objective-C datatypes work a little better.

Note : you will need to tweak the Makefile for your machine.
