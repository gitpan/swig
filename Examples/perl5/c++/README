This is an extremely simple example to test building a C++
module with Perl5.  It has a simple class with some inheritance.
See the file 'shapes.pl' to see how it can be used.

Note : The file "proto.h" in the Perl5.003 causes compiler errors
on some C++ compilers.   To get this to compile you may need to
edit Makefile.template so that the option '-Dexplicit=' appears
on the compile line.
