This directory contains the examples from the SWIG user manual.

Later parts of this example rely on the gd-1.2 library by Thomas
Boutell and may not compile on your machine unless you have this
library installed.  If not, you can read about it in the SWIG User's
Manual.

5/9/97-
Makefiles for NT added.   All of the example except for the gd 
part (graph4) now compiles under NT.
