This example shows how constraints can be applied to function
arguments.  Relies on the SWIG constraints.i library.

The best way to try this example is to look at the file
example.i and issue commands interactively in the Python
interpreter.  Try giving commands with bogus values and see that
SWIG is generating error messages.
