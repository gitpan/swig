SWIGtoXS

(and not have a hangover in the morning)

This example shows how SWIG can interact with a function created
using xsubpp.    Two Perl5 modules are created :

produce :    This is a module created using Perl5's xsubpp compiler.
	     It produces a C array of pointers and returns a 
             pointer to it.    It also has a function for printing
             out array values.

consume :    This is a SWIG generated module containing a function
             that takes a double *, negates all of the values,
             and returns the result in a new array.

The script swigxs.pl shows how it works.

To compile this example, just type 'make'.  You might have to
tweak the file 'Makefile.template' if this fails for some reason.
