SWIG OpenGL example

Last update : 1/1/98

This example wraps the OpenGL library using SWIG. This is
set up to compile under Mesa 2.5.   You may have to hack the
Makefile to get it to compile however.

Windows users can also compile this example using MSVC++ 4.x and
the Microsoft OpenGL library (see below) :

UNIX
====
The following options are available :

make tcl         Builds a version of wish with OpenGL functions
make python      Builds a dynamically loadable Python module.
make perl        Builds a dynamically loadable Perl5 module.

Notes :

1.  This example was built using the header files from Mesa 1.2.8.
    Basically, this process involved the following :

	a.  Copy the header files
        b.  Run SWIG to find parsing problems.
        c.  Eliminate parsing problems until errors go away.
        d.  Compile

2.  When compiling, you may get SWIG warnings about array
    members.   This is normal.

3.  The special function newfv4(w,x,y,z) is used to create a 
small 4 element array.   You'll see it quite alot in the example
scripts.


Examples
========
The Perl, Python, and Tcl directories contain various samples
of using the module.

Windows
=======

You can compile two extensions by running nmake on the file
'Makefile.msc'.  

    nmake /f Makefile.msc tcl              - Builds Tcl Extension
    nmake /f Makefile.msc python           - Builds a Python extension
    nmake /f Makefile.msc perl             - Builds a Perl extension


Post no bills
=============
This whole example was cooked up in an afternoon so there are many
things that could be improved if I had more time....  this is
primarily intended to be a SWIG example that shows how you can take
a big library and make a module out it.  It's not a replacement for
other more well-developed OpenGL modules already available for most
scripting languages.
