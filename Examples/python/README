	
This directory contains examples for Python

All of these examples use the file Makefile.template in the top level
directory. You may need to edit this file by hand if it is incorrect.

If you are using dynamic loading, you can build each example by typing
'make'.  If your machine does not support dynamic loading, you can
type 'make static' which will rebuild the Python interpreter with the
SWIG module added to it.  Static builds rely upon the file 'embed.i'
in the SWIG library.  By default, this file assumes Python 1.5.  If
you are using Python 1.3 or Python1.4, go to the SWIG library and
rename the file embed13.i or embed14.i to 'embed.i'.

For some C++ examples, you may need to use 'make static' as dynamic
loading of C++ modules is not supported equally on all machines.

For static rebuilds, you may need to add the Tcl libraries to the link
line if your installed version of Python has been compiled with the
tkinter module.
