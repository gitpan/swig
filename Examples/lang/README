SWIG Language Module

This example shows how one can write a new SWIG language module.
Writing a new language assumes that you are intimately familiar with
the target scripting language, SWIG typemaps, and C++ programming.

In this case, we build a very simple Tcl module.

Files :

        lang.h          -  Minimal header file needed for a language module
        lang.cxx        -  C++ code for the language.
        lang.map        -  A typemap file containing all of the handling for
                           different datatypes.
        header.swg      -  Header file included by our language module.
        main.cxx        -  Main program needed to start the SWIG parser.
        mylang.cxx      -  A skeleton language module (from the user manual).
