This directory contains examples for Guile.

simple   - The simple example from the user manual.
matrix   - A very simple Matrix example.

You will need to edit the Makefile in this directory by
hand and locate the Guile installation in order to build
the examples.

Last update : March 8, 1997 

The SWIG Guile module was originally developed over a year
ago for use with the Cygnus Guile-iii release by Tom Lord.
This project is now officially dead, but Guile development is
being continued by the Free Software Foundation.   The SWIG1.1b5
release of SWIG is designed to work with FSF Guile 1.0 released
in January of 1997.    The C API to Guile has consequently been
changed to use the new 'gh' interface.  As a result, SWIG 
generated modules will no longer compile with Guile-iii or any
of the other Cygnus Guile releases (sorry).

Guile may be obtained via anonymous FTP at :

        ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu

If you want to use the older Cygnus version of Guile with SWIG, send
e-mail to beazley@cs.utah.edu and I will check out the older Guile
module from RCS and send it to you.


(Disclaimer :  The SWIG guile module needs *alot* of work and a maintainer
who has alot of spare time to devote to it.)
