graph.c

This directory contains a program for combining some very simple
graph algorithms with a Tcl/Tk interface.   It combines some
graph algorithms written in C, a C data structure for representing
nodes and adjacency lists and a Tk interface.

To compile, check the makefile to make sure the include directories
are set right and compile.   To run the program, type "./graph"

This isn't the greatest user interface... in fact, it downright
sucks.  Guess it's a good thing I'm not paid to design GUIs!
