<h1>Simple SWIG Example </h1>

Below is a little evaluator for Tcl commands. Type any valid Tcl command
in and see the result immediately. (you can create Tk widgets too).  SWIG
allows you to dynamically load C extensions into the Tcl/Tk Netscape
plugin.  To see how this works, type the following commands in the
window below.   You should be able to access any of the commands
in the simple example code.

<blockquote>
<tt> <pre>
load ./example.so example
fact 4
mod 9 3
get_time
source test.tcl
</pre> </tt>
</blockquote>

<h3> Important Security Note </h3>

In order for the "load" command to work properly, you need
to install the supplied version of the file "safe.tcl" into the
directory <tt> ~/.tclplug/tcl7.6 </tt>.   This modification relaxes
the Tcl/Tk plugin security policy by allowing you to load dynamic
extensions, source Tcl scripts, and open files in the current directory
(wherever you started Netscape 3.0).    This is primarily provided
to make it easier to play around with the plugin.
