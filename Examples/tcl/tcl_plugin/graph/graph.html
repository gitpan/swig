<h1> Directed Graph Example </h1>
<br>
The following example shows a <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~beazley/SWIG"> SWIG </a> generated extension for
the Tcl/Tk Netscape plugin.   The interface is written in
Tcl/Tk, but the underlying functionality has been implemented
entirely in C.  (Ok, the interface is a little lame, but this
example was only cooked up in an afternoon).

<h3> Instructions </h3>

<ul>
<li> Left mouse button creates a node
<li> Middle mouse button creates a link.  Works as follows : <br> <br>
<ul>
<li> Click on starting node  <img src="sel1.gif" align=top>
<li> Move mouse to end node <img src="sel2.gif" align=top>
<li> Click middle mouse button again <img src="sel3.gif" align=top>
</ul>
<li> Right mouse button will show which nodes are connected or
the shortest path between two nodes (if selected).
<li> The "More edges" button adds more edges to the graph using a
transitive closure algorithm. 

</ul>
