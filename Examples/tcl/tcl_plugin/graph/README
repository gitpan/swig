graph.c

This directory contains a program for combining some very simple
graph algorithms with a Tcl/Tk interface.   It combines some
graph algorithms written in C, a C data structure for representing
nodes and adjacency lists and a Tk interface.

To compile, type 'make'.  This will build a module for the Tcl/Tk
plugin.   Run Navigator 3.0 on the file graph.html to run.
