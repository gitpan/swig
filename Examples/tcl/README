Tcl Examples

This directory contains a variety of very simple SWIG Tcl/Tk examples.
The examples should be compatible with Tcl 7.3, Tk 3.6 and all
newer versions.  Most of the examples have also been tested with Tcl 8.0.

Here's a short summary :

simple        - Simple example from user manual.

tree          - Binary search trees in Tcl.

graph         - Simple code for building directed graphs

except        - One possible way of generating Tcl/Tk exceptions.

tcl_plugin    - Extensions to the Tcl Netscape plugin. (tested with
                beta releases of the plugin, may not work in
                current releases).

c++           - A variety of simple C++ examples.

blttix        - Shows how the SWIG library can be used to combine
                other Tcl extensions.

typemaps      - Examples showing how to use SWIG typemaps.

constant      - Example using the new Tcl constant libraries.

constraint    - Constraints implemented using typemaps.

objc          - An objective-C example.

runtime       - Example showing how to use the SWIG runtime libraries

shadow        - Example using shadow classes

defarg        - How to use default arguments

array         - Interesting example that can manipulate C arrays


To build each example, simply go to that directory and type 'make'.
The following 'make' options are available :

     make              - Build a dynamically loadable module compatible
                         with Tcl 7.x or Tcl 8.x.

     make tcl8         - Build a dynamically loadable module using the
                         Tcl 8.0 object interface.

     make static       - Statically rebuild tclsh/wish with the extension
                         added (for machines without dynamic loading)

     make static8      - Statically rebuild tclsh/wish, but use the
                         Tcl 8.0 object interface.

All examples rely on the file 'Makefile.template' in the top
level directory.  If 'make' fails, you may need to edit this
file to locate your Tcl/Tk installation.

The examples will generally not compile if SWIG has not been
installed.  To run the examples without installing SWIG,
set the SWIG_LIB environment variable to the following :

      setenv SWIG_LIB ${pathname}/SWIG1.1/swig_lib

Where ${pathname} is the path where the SWIG source is located.
