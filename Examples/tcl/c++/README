This directory contains some simple C++ examples.    This
directory is by no means comphrehensive, but it's got many
of the things you can do with SWIG in it.

All of these examples are for Tcl (primarily because it's
extremely easy to rebuild and use with C++).   To compile,
you should be able to type 'make' in each subdirectory.
Compilation relies on the file 'Makefile.template' in the top
level directory.    If compilation fails, you'll need to
edit that file appropriately.

SWIG's support for C++ is an ongoing project.   There are certainly
gaps in the C++ parser.   If you have any ideas on how to improve
the current implementation or if you find any weird bugs, please
let me know.
