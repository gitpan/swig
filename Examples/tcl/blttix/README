This example shows how SWIG can be used to combine different Tcl
extensions.   In this case, Tix and BLT have been combined
into a single wish executable.

You may have to edit the Makefile to find your local copies
of Tix and BLT.

'example.tcl' is a very rudimentary example that creates both
a Tix and BLT widget.

I have only tested this with Tcl 7.6/Tk 4.2.  It is unlikely
to work with newer or older versions of Tcl/Tk.
