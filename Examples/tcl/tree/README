This directory has two simple examples involving binary
search trees.

Type 'make tree' to build a simple tclsh only example for
testing out the algorithms.  Run it by typing 'tree tree.tcl'.
This example hammers on the machine for awhile so give it
a few minutes!

Type 'make findfile' to build a simple Tk application for
searching for files.   To run it just type 'findfile.tcl'.
